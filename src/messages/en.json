    "myStory-p1": "I have always been passionate about illustrated art, and I hold a degree in Cinema from Savannah College of Art and Design in Georgia. After working in the fashion industry for a few years, I decided to follow my true calling: showcasing nature&apos;s raw beauty. Since then, I have been documenting the most incredible animals around the globe. It has been an honor to capture and share these extraordinary moments in the wilderness.",
    "myStory-p2": "As a Brazilian, my primary focus has been on the jaguars of the Pantanal. After experiencing the thrill of capturing these majestic animals in their natural habitat, I decided to become a certified guide, specializing in photographic safaris and private tours.",

    "part1": "Amidst the vastness of the Pantanal, one of the most biodiverse regions in the world, fire spreads relentlessly. In recent years, wildfires have devastated this unique ecosystem, turning its lush flora and fauna into ashes. This region, home to iconic species such as the jaguar, the jabiru stork, and countless others, faces an unprecedented threat.",
    "part2": "Often sparked by human activities, these wildfires cause irreparable destruction, leading to the death of thousands of animals and the loss of essential habitats. In a landscape where life struggles to survive amidst the chaos, the images captured here stand as a testament to the devastating impact of these fires. They remind us of the urgency to protect the Pantanal before it's too late."
