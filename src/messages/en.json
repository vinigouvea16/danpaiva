    "myStory-p1": "I have always been passionate about illustrated art, and I hold a degree in Cinema from Savannah College of Art and Design in Georgia. After working in the fashion industry for a few years, I decided to follow my true calling: showcasing nature&apos;s raw beauty. Since then, I have been documenting the most incredible animals around the globe. It has been an honor to capture and share these extraordinary moments in the wilderness.",
    "myStory-p2": "As a Brazilian, my primary focus has been on the jaguars of the Pantanal. After experiencing the thrill of capturing these majestic animals in their natural habitat, I decided to become a certified guide, specializing in photographic safaris and private tours.",

I aim to teach everything I know about photography, animal behavior, and any other shared interests we may have. I believe that when we do something with passion, it resonates with those around us. You come as a guest, but you leave as a friend.",

"Pantanal": {
   "hero-p": "One of the richest and most biodiverse biomes in Brazil, but it also carries a sad reality: the devastation caused by wildfires. The flames consume the lush flora and threaten the unique fauna that inhabits this region, leaving a trail of destruction and suffering.",
   "story-p": "The Pantanal is where my journey into wildlife began. My first trip took me to this incredible place, and since then, I haven't been able to stop exploring. With its vast expanse, the largest flooded plain in the world is home to an impressive biodiversity, featuring over 600 species of birds and 100 species of mammals. This is undoubtedly one of the best places to observe the majestic jaguar in its natural habitat.",
   "story-p2": "Unfortunately, wildfires, often caused by human actions, devastate the vegetation of the Pantanal each year, having a devastating impact on the fauna. Amidst the chaos, life struggles to survive, and the images captured here serve as a powerful testament to the consequences of these flames. They remind us of the urgency to protect this unique ecosystem before itâ€™s too late.",

    "story-p": "It's almost hard to believe the number of animals present in a single continent. From the endless plains of the Serengeti, where the world's largest mammal migration occurs, to the tropical forests of Uganda, home to the famous mountain gorillas. No matter which country you choose, you can be sure that you will have a unique and wild experience.",
    "story-p2": "Unlike other places where you search for a specific animal, Africa gives you the opportunity to simply explore and encounter a diversity of animals you never thought possible, always with incredible landscapes in the background. Conservation is taken very seriously here, as they understand the importance of this wild world in preserving our planet.",
